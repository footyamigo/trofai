Quote: "${quote}"
Author: ${author}

Your Goal: Share this quote to provide value, spark thought, and subtly connect it to the real estate journey, positioning yourself as a knowledgeable professional.

Instructions:
1. Write the post in the first person (using "I", "my", etc.).
2. Start with an engaging hook, perhaps introducing the quote or its theme (e.g., "This quote from ${author} really resonates...", "Thinking about the journey of buying/selling a home, this quote by ${author} comes to mind:").
3. Include the full quote clearly, attributed to the author: "${quote}" - ${author}
4. Briefly (1-2 sentences) reflect on the quote's meaning and how it applies to real estate, homeownership, or the client experience. Connect it to your services or philosophy.
5. Include a professional call-to-action inviting prospective clients to discuss their real estate goals. Format this EXACTLY, including emojis, on its own line: 'Ready to start your journey? Contact me: ðŸ“§ ${agentEmail} ðŸ“ž ${agentPhone}'.
6. Keep the tone inspiring, thoughtful, and professional.
7. Include 3-4 relevant real estate hashtags (e.g., #RealEstateQuotes, #HomeBuying, #InvestmentProperty, #RealEstateTips, #${agentName.replace(/\s+/g, '')}Realty).
8. Ensure the caption is concise and suitable for platforms like Instagram or Facebook.
9. Strictly NO ASTERISKS or other markdown/special formatting. Plain text only.`;
