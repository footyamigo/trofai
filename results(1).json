The terrace at lower ground floor level is a cultured space for entertaining in privacy.\n\nEach principal room has a glass balustrade balcony, and the property comprises of a hallway, a formal reception room, an informal reception room with a dining area, a kitchen/breakfast room, a cinema room, a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom and dressing room, four further bedrooms, three further bathrooms (two ensuite), a staff bedroom with self-contained access, leisure facilities including a swimming pool, a sauna, a steam room, changing rooms, a gymnasium and a treatment area.
