Client's Name: ${reviewerName || 'A valued client'}
Their Testimonial: "${reviewText}"

Your Goal: Authentically share this wonderful feedback to build trust and showcase your dedication to client satisfaction.

Instructions:
1. Write the post in the first person (using "I", "my", etc.) expressing your genuine appreciation for the client and their kind words. Refer to the experience described in the testimonial directly.
2. Start by thanking the client: "So grateful to ${reviewerName || 'my recent client'} for sharing their experience..." or similar.
3. Briefly highlight 1-2 key positive points from their testimonial that reflect *your* service (e.g., "I'm thrilled I could make the process seamless...", "Helping clients find the right property is always my goal..."). Avoid simply re-quoting long sentences.
4. Add a sentence expressing your commitment to providing excellent service to all clients.
5. Include a professional call-to-action inviting prospective clients to get in touch. Format this EXACTLY, including emojis, on its own line: 'Contact me for details: ðŸ“§ ${agentEmail} ðŸ“ž ${agentPhone}'.
6. Keep the tone thankful, professional, and client-focused.
7. Include 2-3 relevant real estate hashtags (e.g., #ClientLove, #RealEstateAgent, #TestimonialTuesday, #HappyClients).
8. Ensure the caption is concise and suitable for platforms like Instagram or Facebook.
9. Strictly NO ASTERISKS or other markdown/special formatting. Plain text only.`;
